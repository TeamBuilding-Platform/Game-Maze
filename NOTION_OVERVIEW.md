# TeamBuilding Project Overview

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/TeamBuilding-Platform/Game-Maze

## What is TeamBuilding?

A real-time multiplayer game where teams compete to navigate mazes on a shared display. Players join via their phones by scanning a QR code, then control their character using touch controls on their device. The display screen shows the maze, all players, and live game state.

**Live URL**: `http://159.65.197.157:3000`

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (Browser)
- **React 19 + Vite** SPA in `frontend/`, served by the backend from `frontend/dist`
  - Display (big screen) and controller (phone) views per role
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
- **WebSocket** for real-time game sync with server, including automatic
  reconnect with per-tab identity, backoff, and an app-level ping/pong heartbeat
- Runs on both display screen (large monitor) and player phones (mobile browsers)

### Backend (Node.js)
- **Node.js 20** with Express.js
- WebSocket server for live multiplayer comms
- QR code generation for join links
- Session management

### Testing
- **Node.js built-in test runner** (`node --test`)
- 90+ tests covering networking, game logic, reconnect handling, and WebSocket flows

## Infrastructure & Deployment

### Server Hosting
**DigitalOcean Droplet** — `$4/month`
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Size: 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU
- IP: `159.65.197.157`
- Status: Power off when not in use to save costs

### Process Management
**pm2** — free, open-source
- Manages Node.js app process
- Auto-restart on crash
- Auto-start on server reboot via systemd

### Deployment Pipeline
**GitHub Actions** — free (included with GitHub)
- Triggers on every push to `main` branch
- Steps:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Run tests
  3. Package app as tarball
  4. Deploy over SSH to server
  5. Restart app via pm2
- Full deploy takes ~2 minutes

## How to Deploy

```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "your message"

# 2. Push to main
git push origin main

# 3. GitHub Actions automatically:
#    - Tests your code
#    - Packages it
#    - Deploys to the server
#    - Restarts the app

# 4. App live in ~2 minutes at http://159.65.197.157:3000
```

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` in the repo for detailed commands and troubleshooting.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

App runs on `http://localhost:3000`. Phones on the same WiFi network can join via QR code.

---

## Game Flow

1. **Display Setup**: Large monitor/projector shows the maze on startup page
2. **Session Created**: QR code generated and displayed
3. **Players Join**: Teammates scan QR code on their phones
4. **Game Starts**: Display host clicks "Start Game"
5. **Live Gameplay**: Players move their characters; display updates in real-time via WebSocket
6. **End**: Fixed phase flow with follow-up debriefs; sessions survive transient
   disconnects (players auto-reconnect) and are cleaned up after 10 minutes of
   abandonment
