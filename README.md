# TeamBuilding

A real-time multiplayer party game platform with a Jackbox-style architecture.
A big-screen **display** hosts the session; players join from their phones as **controllers**.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open:
- `http://localhost:3000/` on the TV/browser — this is the **display** screen
- Scan the QR code from a phone to open the **controller** screen

## React frontend scaffold (for AI Studio overhaul)

The repo now includes `frontend/` (React + Vite) as a separate frontend workspace that talks to the existing backend.

```bash
npm run frontend:dev
```

Or directly:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend contract details for the new UI live in `frontend/README.md`.

## Host online

This app can also run on a public host. When the display is opened through a real domain or public IP, new sessions now generate QR codes and join links that reuse that public URL, so remote devices can connect directly over the internet.

If your hosting setup sits behind a proxy or you want to force a specific public URL, set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` before starting the server:

```bash
PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://your-app.example.com npm start
```

When running locally on `localhost`, the server still falls back to your LAN IP so phones on the same network can join.

### Mobile connection reliability tuning

The WebSocket heartbeat/grace window is configurable for mobile-heavy sessions:

- `WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` – ping cadence (default: `4000`)
- `WS_MAX_MISSED_HEARTBEATS` – consecutive missed heartbeats before the server terminates the socket (default: `3`)
- `WS_DISCONNECT_GRACE_MS` – how long to keep a disconnected socket before cleanup (default: `60000`)

Recommended starting point for mobile devices that may sleep/lock:

```bash
WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS=4000
WS_MAX_MISSED_HEARTBEATS=3
WS_DISCONNECT_GRACE_MS=60000
```

## Deploy with GitHub Actions

This repository includes a CI/CD workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

- On pull requests: it installs dependencies, runs `npm test`, and packages a release artifact.
- On pushes to `main` (or manual `workflow_dispatch`): it runs the same CI steps, then deploys the artifact to a VPS over SSH.

### Required repository secrets

Set these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `DEPLOY_HOST` – hostname/IP of your server
- `DEPLOY_USER` – SSH user for deployment
- `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` – private SSH key for `DEPLOY_USER`
- `DEPLOY_PATH` – deployment directory on the server (example: `/var/www/teambuilding`)
- `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` – public base URL used by the app for join/session links (example: `https://game.example.com`)

Optional:

- `PORT` – runtime port on the server (defaults to `3000`)

### Deployment assumptions

- The target server has Node.js and `npm` installed.
- The workflow writes `.env` with `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` (and `PORT`) inside each release.
- If `pm2` is installed on the server, the workflow restarts the app automatically as process `teambuilding`.
- If `pm2` is not installed, the workflow still uploads/releases the app and prints the manual start command.

### WebSocket message types

| Direction | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Client → Server | `display_register` | Big screen claims display role for a session |
| Client → Server | `controller_join` | Phone joins session as a controller |
| Client → Server | `game_start` | Display requests game start |
| Client → Server | `game_restart` | Display restarts an ended session |
| Client → Server | `timer_start` | Display starts or resumes the session timer |
| Client → Server | `timer_stop` | Display pauses the session timer |
| Client → Server | `timer_reset` | Display resets the session timer |
| Client → Server | `followup_end` | Display or trainer ends follow-up; the last follow-up restarts a fresh round, while terminal failures end the session |
| Client → Server | `player_input` | Controller sends an action (e.g. `{ action: "buzz" }`) |
| Client → Server | `resync_request` | Any client requests a full state re-send (reconnect) |
| Client → Server | `ping` | App-level heartbeat; clients use it to detect half-dead connections |
| Server → Client | `client_registered` | Acknowledges display/controller registration |
| Server → Client | `state_sync` | Authoritative game state broadcast to all clients |
| Server → Client | `join_error` | Registration or join failure |
| Server → Client | `pong` | Reply to a client `ping` |
| Server → Client | `session_closed` | (Legacy) Session ended and was removed; currently not emitted by the server |

All server-sent WebSocket messages now include protocol version `v`.
Clients may send either the legacy flat payload format or an envelope format:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "type": "controller_join",
  "payload": {
    "sessionId": "ABC123",
    "name": "Alex"
  }
}
```

`join_error` also includes a machine-readable `code` for reconnect/join handling.

Sessions are now kept server-side across transient disconnects. A display disconnect no longer destroys the
session immediately; connected clients receive updated state showing `displayConnected: false` until the host
reattaches or later reconnect handling claims the session.

Abandoned sessions no longer live forever. If a session has no connected display and no connected controllers,
the server automatically closes it after 10 minutes. A returning display or controller reconnect cancels that
pending cleanup window.

Controllers now receive a reconnect token in `client_registered`, and the client stores it locally to support
automatic/manual rejoin of the same player slot when the session still exists. Reconnect handling is forgiving:

- A join carrying a stale or unknown `reconnectToken` is never rejected; the server falls back to a normal join
  (claiming an open disconnected slot mid-game, inheriting its slot-bound roles) and issues a fresh token.
- In the lobby, a fresh join whose name matches a player whose socket is dead or in the disconnect grace window
  takes over that player slot instead of creating a duplicate.
- The frontend silently auto-resumes in the same tab (stored token + `?session=` in the URL — no name or session
  re-entry), retries with exponential backoff, and reconnects immediately when the network returns or the tab
  becomes visible. A client-side `ping`/`pong` heartbeat force-closes half-dead sockets so reconnects start fast.

The server also now maintains authoritative timer state with `idle`, `running`, `stopped`, and `expired`
lifecycle states. Timer transitions are included in synchronized state and persisted session exports.
The display exposes start / pause / reset timer controls, and controllers show compact timer status.

Gameplay sessions now run on a fixed flow after `game_start`: **phase 1 (15 min)**, **phase 2 (10 min)**,
**phase 3 (5 min)**, each followed by a **follow-up** phase where gameplay is paused and clients show a compact
follow-up indicator while hiding normal gameplay UI. The final follow-up immediately restarts a fresh round;
terminal failures still end the session. The trainer can still pause, resume, and reset the active gameplay phase
timer when facilitation needs it.

### Game state shape

```json
{
  "status": "lobby | playing | follow_up | ended",
  "players": [{ "id": "uuid", "name": "Alice" }],
  "roles": { "<playerId>": "mover | guide" },
  "maze": {
    "width": 7, "height": 7,
    "cells": [[{ "walls": { "n": true, "e": false, "s": false, "w": true } }]],
    "hazards": [{ "row": 2, "col": 3 }],
    "goal": { "row": 6, "col": 6 },
    "playerPos": { "row": 0, "col": 0 },
    "reached": false,
    "hitHazards": 0
  },
  "log": [
    { "ts": 1700000000000, "event": "game_start" },
    { "ts": 1700000001000, "event": "move", "player": "Alice", "dir": "e", "result": "ok", "from": { "row": 0, "col": 0 }, "to": { "row": 0, "col": 1 } },
    { "ts": 1700000002000, "event": "session_end", "outcome": "success", "keys": 3, "lives": 1 }
  ]
}
```

### Adding a minigame

The maze game is already implemented as the first minigame.  It follows this pattern and can serve as a reference:

1. Add minigame state fields to the session's `state` object in `SessionManager`.
2. Handle `player_input` in `handleInput()` to update state server-side.
3. Call `broadcastState()` after each update — all clients receive `state_sync`.
4. Add display-side rendering in `frontend/src/components/display/` and controller UI in `frontend/src/components/controller/`.

The shared message type constants live in `src/protocol.js`.

### Maze game

The first minigame uses **asymmetric information** to surface clarity issues in communication and role assignment:

| Role | Can do | Can see |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Trainer** (explicitly selected on join; unlimited seats) | Observe, scroll realtime events, log clarity events, toggle highlights, and share either full logs or curated highlights via `trainer_share_log` / `trainer_share_highlights` | Combined mini-maze overview + full trainer event feed |
| **Mover** (randomized gameplay role) | Send `player_input` with `{ action: "move", dir: "n|e|s|w" }` | Grid + own position only |
| **Guide** (randomized gameplay role) | Communicate hazards and ghost pressure | Hazard locations, ghost positions, + player position |
| **Key Seer** (randomized gameplay role) | Communicate key objectives | Key locations + player position |
| **Navigator** (randomized gameplay role) | Communicate wall layout and risky routes | Maze walls + player position |

When fewer than 4 gameplay players are present, roles are merged:
- 3 players: `mover`, `key-seer`, and `guide+navigator`
- 2 players: `mover+key-seer` and `guide+navigator`

The display screen shows everything (walls, hazards, ghosts, player position, event log) for the facilitator.
The session log now renders as a color-coded chronological timeline with scroll support. It auto-follows
new events during play, and facilitators can scroll back to inspect older moments.

When a round ends, the display shows a restart button so the host can start a fresh round without rebuilding the session.

Every move — including wall hits, ghost collisions, and hazard encounters — is appended to `state.log` so the session can be debriefed afterwards. A ghost now spawns every round, layout variants still rotate on resets, and hard mode increases hazard pressure after repeated failures. When `state.status` becomes `"ended"`, the log contains the complete play-through including `hitHazards` count.

### Durable session log export

Session logs are also persisted to `session-logs/<SESSION_ID>.json` on the server host.  
You can fetch the current/persisted export JSON with:

`GET /api/session/:sessionId/log`

Operational lifecycle diagnostics (session creation, joins, reconnects, disconnect grace windows, WebSocket
close/error cases, and abandoned-session cleanup) are emitted to the normal server logs / `pm2 logs`.
